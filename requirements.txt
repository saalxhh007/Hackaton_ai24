# Real-Time Face Recognition and Entry/Exit Detection System

This project is a computer vision-based system designed to detect and recognize individuals as they enter or exit a room. It uses object detection to identify doors, face recognition to identify people, and tracks individuals in real-time to determine room occupancy and movement patterns.

## 🚀 Features

- 🎯 Door detection using object detection models (YOLO or similar)
- 🧠 Face detection and recognition with real-time tracking
- 🔁 Entry/Exit detection using bounding box logic and line crossing
- 👤 Person tracking and ID assignment
- 📝 Logging of individual entries and exits
- 📸 Optional image capture or video stream input

## 📦 Tech Stack

- Python
- OpenCV
- Dlib / FaceNet / DeepFace (for face recognition)
- YOLOv5 / YOLOv8 / custom model (for object/door detection)
- NumPy, Pandas
- (Optional) Flask/FastAPI for backend integration

## 📂 Project Structure


## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **Door Detection**: Detect doors and define a virtual entrance line using the bottom edge of the door's bounding box.
2. **Face Detection & Recognition**: Detect faces and compare them against a known database.
3. **Tracking**: Track each person across frames using a tracker (e.g., SORT, Deep SORT).
4. **Line Crossing Logic**: When a tracked individual crosses the entrance line:
   - If entering → mark as "entered"
   - If exiting → mark as "exited"
5. **Logging**: Save timestamps, identities, and entry/exit events to a file or database.

## ✅ Installation

1. Clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/room-entry-face-tracker.git
cd room-entry-face-tracker
